    No personal access token found.
    Please create a personal access token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

    `main-branch` uses a personal access token for:

    • Edit access to repositories.
    • Higher rate limits.
    • Access to private repositories.

    (At the moment, `main-branch` also requires a personal access token to work for public operations.)

    This token will be saved in plain text at: /Users/lgarron/.config/main-branch/github-personal-access-token
    You can revoke the personal access token in GitHub or delete the file at any time.
